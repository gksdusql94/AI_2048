## ðŸ§  Algorithmic                 
### Minimax Algorithm
The AI player employs the minimax algorithm, which is used in adversarial search scenarios to minimize potential losses assuming optimal opponent behavior.

```python
def getMove(self, grid):
    best_value = maxsize * -1
    for move in grid.getAvailableMoves():
        temp_grid = grid.clone()
        temp_grid.move(move)
        value = self.min(Node(move=move, grid=temp_grid, depth=DEPTH-1))
        if value > best_value:
            best_move = move
```


### Alpha-Beta Pruning
To improve the efficiency of the minimax algorithm, the AI player utilizes alpha-beta pruning. Alpha-beta pruning reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree by eliminating branches that are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the final decision.

```python
def min(self, node, alpha, beta):
    for child in children:
        value = self.max(child, alpha, beta)
        if value < beta:
            beta = value
        if alpha >= beta:
            break
    return beta
```

### Heuristic Functions
Custom heuristics guide the AI by evaluating the desirability of game states. This includes factors like:

- The number of empty cells.
- Monotonicity of the tile arrangement.
- Whether the highest tile is in a corner

```python
def evaluate(grid):
    number_of_blank_tiles = len(grid.getAvailableCells())
    max_tile = grid.getMaxTile()
    bonus = 10 if max_tile in [grid.map[0][0], grid.map[0][3]] else 0
    return number_of_blank_tiles + bonus
```

## ðŸš€ Instrutions
Run the game

```python
python GameManager.py
```
## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview

- PlayerAI_3.py: Implements AI logic with Expectiminimax and heuristics.
- ComputerAI_3.py: Controls computer moves by inserting tiles randomly.
- Grid_3.py: Handles all operations related to the game board (e.g., tile movement, merging).
- Displayer_3.py: Manages grid display.
- GameManager_3.py: Manages game flow, alternating between AI and computer turns.

## ðŸ“Š Code Overview
The AI explores all possible game moves using the Expectiminimax algorithm. Each state is evaluated using a weighted function to prioritize empty tiles, grid monotonicity, and corner positions for high-value tiles.

```python
def evaluate(grid):
    # Return a weighted sum of the heuristic factors
    return len(grid.getAvailableCells()) + monotonicity_score + corner_bonus
```
## Conclusion
The 2048 Puzzle AI Player project showcases the power of algorithms like minimax and alpha-beta pruning in solving game challenges. With the provided structure, you can easily modify and improve the AI for better performance.
